# 🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset. The analysis and model were implemented in Python, using libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# 🧠 Techniques Used
Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Handling Class Imbalance (undersampling to balance legit vs. fraud transactions)

Train/Test Split and Feature Selection

Logistic Regression Model

Model Evaluation using Accuracy

# 📌 Key Insights
The dataset contains 492 fraud cases out of 284,807 transactions.

A balanced sample was created to effectively train the model.

The Logistic Regression model performs reasonably well on the balanced dataset, showing almost similar accuracy on training and test data.
