# 🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset. The analysis and model were implemented in Python, using libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

# 🧠 Techniques Used
Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Handling Class Imbalance (undersampling to balance legit vs. fraud transactions)

Train/Test Split and Feature Selection

Logistic Regression Model

Model Evaluation using Accuracy

# 📌 Key Insights
The dataset contains 492 fraud cases out of 284,807 transactions.

A balanced sample was created to effectively train the model.

The Logistic Regression model performs reasonably well on the balanced dataset, showing the importance of handling class imbalance in fraud detection tasks.
